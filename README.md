# Road Crosser
Game inspired by the famous game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger)

## The Game
The objective of the game is to get a character to the other side of the screen. Depending on the level this has to be done different amount of times to advance to the next level (starts at 2 and changes at levels 6, 11, 16, 21 and 31). 

The player starts with three lives which he loses if he hits any of the enemies. There are also extra lives that rarely appear and move very fast.

### Enemies

- **Snakes** The most common enemy, they don't move too fast.
- **Hyenas** They move quite faster than snakes but there are also significantly less of them. At higher levels they become more popular.
- **Bats** They move at an intermediate speed but have the ability to switch lanes. They have very low probablity of appearing at the lower levels but become increasingly common as the game goes on.
